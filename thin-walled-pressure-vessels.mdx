1. **Calculate** hoop and longitudinal stresses in cylindrical pressure vessels
2. **Design** wall thickness for pneumatic actuator casings
3. **Apply** safety factors and failure criteria for pressurized systems

## üîß Real-World System Problem: Pneumatic Actuator Casing

<BionicText method="advanced" intensity="medium" class="highlight">
Pneumatic actuators are essential components in industrial automation, robotics, and mechatronic systems. The cylindrical pressure vessel casing must safely contain high-pressure air while providing mounting points, ports, and sealing surfaces.
</BionicText>

### System Description

**Pneumatic Actuator Components:**
- **Cylindrical Casing** (contains pressurized air)
- **Piston Assembly** (converts pressure to linear force)
- **End Caps** (seal the cylinder ends)
- **Ports and Fittings** (air inlet/outlet connections)
- **Mounting Brackets** (attachment points)

### The Pressure Vessel Challenge

A pneumatic actuator casing experiences complex stress states:

:::note[Critical Design Challenges]
- **Hoop stress** from internal pressure trying to "burst" the cylinder
- **Longitudinal stress** from pressure acting on the end caps
- **Stress concentrations** around ports and mounting holes
- **Fatigue loading** from cyclic pressure variations
- **Safety requirements** for personnel protection
:::

> **Engineering Question:** How do we determine the minimum wall thickness for a pneumatic actuator casing operating at 6 bar (600 kPa) pressure while maintaining adequate safety margins?

### Why Pressure Vessel Analysis Matters

**Consequences of Poor Design:**
- **Catastrophic failure** with potential for injury
- **Leakage** leading to performance degradation
- **Excessive deformation** affecting actuator precision
- **Premature fatigue failure** in cyclic applications

**Benefits of Proper Design:**
- **Safe operation** within design pressure limits
- **Reliable performance** over service life
- **Cost optimization** through appropriate wall thickness
- **Regulatory compliance** with pressure vessel codes

## üìö Fundamental Theory: Pressure Vessel Mechanics

### Basic Pressure Vessel Geometry

For **thin-walled** pressure vessels, we assume:
- Wall thickness **t** &lt;&lt; radius **r** (typically t/r &lt; 0.1)
- Stress is uniform across wall thickness
- Internal pressure **p** acts normal to all surfaces

### Hoop Stress (Circumferential Stress)

Internal pressure creates **hoop stress** that tries to burst the cylinder:

<Card title="üîÑ Hoop Stress Formula" icon="document">
$$\sigma_h = \frac{pr}{t}$$

**Where:**
- $\sigma_h$ = Hoop stress (Pa)
- $p$ = Internal pressure (Pa)
- $r$ = Internal radius (m)
- $t$ = Wall thickness (m)

**Physical Meaning:** Hoop stress acts circumferentially, trying to expand the cylinder radially. This is typically the maximum stress in cylindrical pressure vessels.
</Card>

:::tip[Physical Understanding]
Imagine trying to stretch a rubber band - the hoop stress acts similarly, trying to expand the cylinder circumferentially. This is typically the **highest stress** in cylindrical pressure vessels.
:::

### Longitudinal Stress (Axial Stress)

Pressure acting on the end caps creates **longitudinal stress** in the cylinder walls:

<Card title="‚ÜïÔ∏è Longitudinal Stress Formula" icon="document">
$$\sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t}$$

**Where:**
- $\sigma_l$ = Longitudinal stress (Pa)
- $p$ = Internal pressure (Pa)
- $r$ = Internal radius (m)
- $t$ = Wall thickness (m)

**Physical Meaning:** Longitudinal stress acts along the cylinder axis due to pressure force on the end caps. Note that it's exactly half the hoop stress.
</Card>

:::note[Key Insight]
Longitudinal stress is **exactly half** the hoop stress in cylindrical vessels. This explains why cylindrical pressure vessels typically fail by splitting lengthwise rather than across their width.

    **Hoop Stress:** $\sigma_h = \frac{pr}{t}$
    
    **Longitudinal Stress:** $\sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t}$
    
    **Stress Ratio:** $\frac{\sigma_h}{\sigma_l} = 2:1$
    
    **Physical Meaning:** Hoop stress is always twice the longitudinal stress in cylindrical pressure vessels, making it the critical design parameter.

  <TabItem label="Spherical Vessels">
    
    **Spherical vessels have equal stresses:**

    - Critical applications: SF = 6-10

## üîß Application: Pneumatic Actuator Casing Design

Let's design a pneumatic actuator casing for an industrial automation system.

:::note[Problem Statement]
**Industrial Pneumatic Actuator Casing Design**

**What we need to determine:**
1. **Minimum wall thickness** based on hoop and longitudinal stress
2. **Actual safety factors** with selected standard thickness
3. **Stress concentration effects** around ports and fittings
4. **Fatigue life assessment** for cyclic pressure loading

**Key Question:** What minimum wall thickness is required for a 100 mm diameter pneumatic actuator casing operating at 6 bar pressure with SF = 4.0?
:::

<hr />

**System Parameters:**
- Industrial pneumatic actuator casing (cylindrical pressure vessel)
- Working pressure: **`p`** = 6 bar = 0.6 MPa
- Internal diameter: 100 mm (radius **`r`** = 50 mm)
- Material: Aluminum 6061-T6 (**`œÉ_yield`** = 270 MPa)
- **`Safety factor`**: 4.0
- Pressure cycles: 10‚Å∂ cycles (fatigue consideration)
- Design standards: ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, ISO 4393

<hr />

### Step 1: Calculate Required Wall Thickness

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal wall thickness calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Determine allowable stress:**
   
   $$\sigma_{allowable} = \frac{\sigma_{yield}}{SF} = \frac{270}{4.0} = 67.5 \text{ MPa}$$

2. **Calculate minimum thickness from hoop stress:**
   
   From $\sigma_h = \frac{pr}{t}$, solving for thickness:
   $$t_{min} = \frac{pr}{\sigma_{allowable}} = \frac{0.6 \times 10^6 \times 0.05}{67.5 \times 10^6} = 0.444 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} = 0.44 \text{ mm}$$

3. **Check longitudinal stress:**
   
   $$\sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t} = \frac{0.6 \times 10^6 \times 0.05}{2 \times 0.44 \times 10^{-3}} = 34.1 \text{ MPa}$$
   
   Since œÉ_l < œÉ_allowable ‚úÖ, hoop stress governs the design

4. **Select standard thickness:**
   
   **Design thickness: 3.0 mm** (standard aluminum sheet with safety margin)

</Steps>

</details>

### Step 2: Verify Design with Selected Thickness

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal design verification calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Actual hoop stress with t = 3.0 mm:**
   
   $$\sigma_h = \frac{pr}{t} = \frac{0.6 \times 10^6 \times 0.05}{3.0 \times 10^{-3}} = 10.0 \text{ MPa}$$

2. **Actual longitudinal stress:**
   
   $$\sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t} = \frac{0.6 \times 10^6 \times 0.05}{2 \times 3.0 \times 10^{-3}} = 5.0 \text{ MPa}$$

3. **Actual safety factors:**
   
   - Hoop stress: SF = 270/10.0 = **27.0** 
   - Longitudinal stress: SF = 270/5.0 = **54.0**
   - Both exceed required SF = 4.0 by large margins

4. **Design assessment:**
   
   Very conservative design appropriate for personnel safety, stress concentrations, and manufacturing variations

</Steps>

</details>

### Step 3: Stress Concentration and Fatigue Assessment

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal stress concentration and fatigue analysis**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Stress concentration factors:**
   
   - Ports and fittings: Kt = 2-4
   - Mounting holes: Kt = 2.5-3.5
   - Welds and joints: Kt = 1.5-2.5
   - Local stresses can be 2-4√ó nominal values

2. **Fatigue life assessment:**
   
   - Pressure cycles: 0 to 6 bar (fully reversed)
   - Stress amplitude: œÉa = (10.0 - 0)/2 = 5.0 MPa
   - Aluminum endurance limit ‚âà 110 MPa
   - Fatigue safety factor: 110/5.0 = 22 ‚úÖ Excellent

3. **Design recommendations:**
   
   - Round all corners to minimize stress concentrations
   - Add reinforcement around openings
   - Use higher local safety factors near discontinuities
   - Consider dynamic pressure effects (up to 150% static)

</Steps>

## üéØ Advanced Analysis: Fatigue and Dynamic Loading

### Fatigue Considerations

Pneumatic actuators experience **cyclic pressure loading**:

**Pressure Cycles:**
- Minimum pressure: 0 bar (atmospheric)
- Maximum pressure: 6 bar (working pressure)
- **Stress amplitude:** $\sigma_a = \frac{\sigma_{max} - \sigma_{min}}{2} = \frac{10.0 - 0}{2} = 5.0 \text{ MPa}$

**Fatigue Life Assessment:**
For aluminum, the **endurance limit** is typically 35-40% of ultimate strength.

With ultimate strength ‚âà 310 MPa:
- Endurance limit ‚âà 110 MPa
- Applied stress amplitude: 5.0 MPa
- **Fatigue safety factor:** 110/5.0 = 22 ‚úÖ **Excellent fatigue resistance**

### Dynamic Pressure Effects

**Rapid pressurization** can create higher stresses than static analysis predicts:

:::caution[Dynamic Considerations]
- **Pressure spikes** during valve operation (up to 150% of steady-state)
- **Water hammer** effects in hydraulic systems
- **Resonance** at specific cycling frequencies
- **Temperature effects** on material properties
