## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Analyze** composite beams made of different materials using the transformed section method
2. **Locate** the neutral axis in composite beam cross-sections
3. **Calculate** bending stresses in each material of a composite system
4. **Design** hybrid structures for optimal strength-to-weight performance

## üîß Real-World System Problem: CNC Machine Bed Structure

<BionicText method="advanced" intensity="medium" class="highlight">
High-precision CNC machines require extremely rigid bed structures to maintain accuracy during cutting operations. Modern CNC beds often use composite construction - combining steel reinforcement with aluminum casting to achieve optimal stiffness, weight, and thermal stability while managing cost.
</BionicText>

### System Description

**CNC Machine Bed Components:**
- **Steel Reinforcement Beams** (high stiffness backbone structure)
- **Aluminum Casting** (lightweight material filling and mounting surfaces)
- **Composite Cross-Section** (steel beams encased in aluminum)
- **Precision Ways** (guided surfaces for machine tools)
- **Vibration Damping** (integrated damping materials)

### The Composite Challenge

During machining operations, the CNC bed experiences:

:::note[Critical Loading Conditions]
- **Heavy cutting forces** transmitted through the tool and workpiece
- **Dynamic loads** from rapid axis movements and accelerations
- **Thermal gradients** from machining heat and environmental changes
- **Vibration loads** that must be damped to maintain surface finish
- **Long-term creep** under sustained loads
:::

> **Engineering Question:** How do we analyze the stress distribution in a composite CNC bed where steel reinforcement beams are encased in aluminum, and how do we ensure both materials work together effectively under bending loads?

### Why Composite Beam Analysis Matters

**Consequences of Poor Composite Design:**
- **Interfacial failure** between steel and aluminum layers
- **Uneven stress distribution** leading to premature failure
- **Excessive deflection** reducing machining accuracy
- **Thermal stress cracking** from differential expansion

**Benefits of Proper Composite Analysis:**
- **Optimized material usage** leveraging each material's strengths
- **Predictable load sharing** between different materials
- **Enhanced structural performance** compared to single materials
- **Cost-effective design** balancing performance and economics

## üìö Fundamental Theory: Composite Beam Mechanics

### Basic Composite Beam Assumptions

For composite beams with **perfect bonding** between materials:

1. **Plane sections remain plane** during bending
2. **No slip occurs** at material interfaces  
3. **Strain is continuous** across the cross-section
4. **Each material follows** its own stress-strain relationship

### The Transformed Section Method

Since different materials have different elastic moduli, we transform the composite section into an equivalent single-material section:

<Card title="üîÑ Transformation Ratio Formula" icon="document">
$$n = \frac{E_2}{E_1}$$

**Where:**
- $n$ = Transformation ratio (dimensionless)
- $E_2$ = Elastic modulus of material to be transformed
- $E_1$ = Elastic modulus of reference material

**Physical Meaning:** The transformation ratio allows us to convert a composite beam into an equivalent single-material beam by adjusting the width of one material based on stiffness differences.
</Card>

:::tip[Transformation Strategy]
**Transform stiffer material to softer:** If steel (E = 200 GPa) and aluminum (E = 70 GPa):
$$n = \frac{E_{steel}}{E_{aluminum}} = \frac{200}{70} = 2.86$$

The steel section is replaced by an aluminum section **2.86 times wider**.

    - Calculate transformation ratio n = E‚ÇÇ/E‚ÇÅ
    - Transform width: b‚ÇÇ,transformed = n √ó b‚ÇÇ,actual

  <TabItem label="Step 2: Locate Neutral Axis">
    
    <Card title="üéØ Neutral Axis Location" icon="document">
    $$\bar{y} = \frac{\sum A_i y_i}{\sum A_i}$$
    
    **Where:**
    - $\bar{y}$ = Distance to neutral axis from reference (m)
    - $A_i$ = Transformed area of each section (m¬≤)
    - $y_i$ = Distance from reference to centroid of each area (m)
    
    **Physical Meaning:** The neutral axis location is found using the weighted average of transformed areas.
    </Card>
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Step 3: Calculate Properties">
    
    **Calculate moment of inertia** of transformed section:
    $$I_{transformed} = \sum (I_i + A_i d_i^2)$$
    
    Using parallel axis theorem
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Step 4: Find Stresses">
    
    <Card title="‚ö° Composite Beam Stress Formulas" icon="document">
    **Reference material stress:**
    $$\sigma_1 = \frac{My}{I_{transformed}}$$
    
    **Transformed material stress:**
    $$\sigma_2 = n \times \frac{My}{I_{transformed}}$$
    
    **Where:**
    - $M$ = Applied bending moment (N¬∑m)
    - $y$ = Distance from neutral axis (m)
    - $I_{transformed}$ = Moment of inertia of transformed section (m‚Å¥)
    - $n$ = Transformation ratio
    
    **Physical Meaning:** Stresses in composite beams are calculated using the transformed section, with the transformed material stress adjusted by the transformation ratio.

### Step 1: Calculate Transformation Ratio

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal transformation ratio calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Choose aluminum as reference material:**
   
   $$n = \frac{E_{steel}}{E_{aluminum}} = \frac{200}{70} = 2.86$$

2. **Transform steel section to equivalent aluminum:**
   
   - Steel I-beam actual: 150 mm flanges, 8 mm web
   - Steel I-beam transformed: 150 √ó 2.86 = 429 mm flanges, 8 √ó 2.86 = 23 mm web

3. **Analysis approach:**
   
   Analyze transformed section as all-aluminum, then convert steel stresses using transformation ratio

</Steps>

</details>

### Step 2: Locate Neutral Axis of Transformed Section

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal neutral axis calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Aluminum region (original):**
   
   - Total area minus steel: A‚ÇÅ = (300√ó250) - (150√ó200-8√ó176) = 46,408 mm¬≤
   - Centroid from bottom: »≥‚ÇÅ ‚âà 125 mm (approximate due to steel cutout)

2. **Steel region (transformed to aluminum):**
   
   - Transformed area: A‚ÇÇ = 28,592 mm¬≤ (actual steel area)
   - Centroid from bottom: »≥‚ÇÇ = 125 mm (center of I-beam)

3. **Combined centroid location:**
   
   $$\bar{y} = \frac{A_1 \bar{y_1} + A_2 \bar{y_2}}{A_1 + A_2} = \frac{46,408 \times 125 + 28,592 \times 125}{46,408 + 28,592} = 125 \text{ mm}$$
   
   Neutral axis at geometric center (125 mm from bottom) due to symmetry

</Steps>

</details>

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Bending Moment and Stresses

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal bending moment and stress calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Maximum bending moment:**
   
   For simply supported beam with uniform load:
   $$M_{max} = \frac{wL^2}{8} = \frac{50,000 \times 2^2}{8} = 25,000 \text{ N¬∑m}$$

2. **Transformed section moment of inertia:**
   
   $$I_{transformed} = 2.1 \times 10^8 \text{ mm}^4$$ (calculated for composite section)

3. **Maximum distance from neutral axis:**
   
   c = 125 mm (to top or bottom fiber)

</Steps>

</details>

### Step 4: Calculate Stresses and Safety Factors

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal stress and safety factor calculations**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Stress in aluminum regions:**
   
   $$\sigma_{aluminum} = \frac{My}{I} = \frac{25,000 \times 10^3 \times 125}{2.1 \times 10^8} = 14.9 \text{ MPa}$$

2. **Stress in steel regions:**
   
   $$\sigma_{steel} = n \times \sigma_{aluminum} = 2.86 \times 14.9 = 42.6 \text{ MPa}$$

3. **Safety factor assessment:**
   
   - Aluminum: SF = 140/14.9 = 9.4 ‚úÖ Very conservative
   - Steel: SF = 250/42.6 = 5.9 ‚úÖ Safe design
   - Both exceed required SF = 2.0

4. **Load distribution analysis:**
   
   Steel carries 2.86√ó more stress per unit strain, efficiently using its higher strength

</Steps>

## üéØ Advanced Analysis: Interface Considerations

### Bond Strength Requirements

The interface between steel and aluminum must transfer **shear forces** to maintain composite action:

**Interface shear stress:**
$$\tau = \frac{VQ}{It}$$

Where Q is the first moment of area of the steel section about the neutral axis.

### Thermal Stress Effects
