<very detailed solutions e.g.:>
### Step 1: Calculate Support Reaction Forces

<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal equilibrium calculations**</summary>
<use standard latex formulae and not unicode>
<Steps>

1. **Account for distributed loading effects:**

   Distributed load total force: W = w × L_total = 800 × 4.0 = 3200 N

   This acts at the centroid of the beam: x̄ = 2.0 m from A ✅

2. **Apply dynamic amplification factor:**

   Applied loads with dynamic effects:
   - P₁_dynamic = 1.4 × 5000 = 7000 N
   - P₂_dynamic = 1.4 × 3000 = 4200 N
   - W remains at 3200 N (self-weight not amplified) ✅

3. **Calculate reaction at support B using moment equilibrium about A:**

   $$\sum M_A = 0: R_B(3.0) - 7000(1.5) - 3200(2.0) - 4200(4.0) = 0$$
   $$R_B = \frac{10500 + 6400 + 16800}{3.0} = \frac{33700}{3.0} = 11233 \text{ N}$$ ✅

4. **Calculate reaction at support A using force equilibrium:**

   $$\sum F_y = 0: R_A + 11233 - 7000 - 3200 - 4200 = 0$$
   $$R_A = 14400 - 11233 = 3167 \text{ N}$$ ✅

5. **Verify equilibrium check:**

   $$\sum F_y = 3167 + 11233 - 7000 - 3200 - 4200 = 0$$ ✅

</Steps>
