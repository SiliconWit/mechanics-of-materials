- **Lesson 1.3**: Compound Bars (Multi-material linear actuators)
- **Lesson 1.4**: Thermal Stresses (Heated piston-cylinder systems)
- **Lesson 1.5**: Torsion of Circular Shafts (Geneva mechanism crankshafts)
- **Lesson 1.6**: Thin-Walled Pressure Vessels (Pneumatic actuator casings)

### Chapter 2: Advanced Analysis
- **Lesson 2.1**: Shear Force and Bending Moments (Robotic arm segments)
- **Lesson 2.2**: Bending Stresses (Cantilever robotic gripper jaws)
- **Lesson 2.3**: Beam Deflections (CNC spindle stiffness analysis)
- **Lesson 2.4**: Combined Loading (Robotic wrist joints)
- **Lesson 2.5**: Composite Beams (CNC machine bed structures)
- **Lesson 2.6**: Principal Stresses (Universal joint failure analysis)

## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

### Systems-Based Learning
Each lesson follows our proven pedagogical structure:

### Content Format Standards
All lessons follow a strict format pattern based on `strain-and-mechanical-properties.mdx`:

**Application Section Structure:**
```mdx
:::note[Problem Statement]
**What we need to determine:**
1. Point 1
2. Point 2
**Key Question:** Specific engineering question?
:::

<hr />

**System Parameters:**
- Parameter descriptions with **`highlighted`** values

<hr />

### Step 1: Description
<details>
<summary>**Click to reveal calculations**</summary>

<Steps>
1. **Sub-step 1:**
   Calculation details
</Steps>
</details>
```
