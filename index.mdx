**Mechanics of Materials**, also called **Solid Mechanics**, **Strength of Materials**, or **Mechanics of Deformable Bodies**, is the branch of engineering that studies how solid objects deform and fail under applied forces, moments, and environmental conditions. This fundamental discipline provides the theoretical foundation for designing safe, efficient, and reliable mechanical components in everything from tiny MEMS devices to massive aerospace structures.

This course explores how materials behave when subjected to forces and deformations—knowledge essential for designing robust mechatronic systems that integrate mechanical, electrical, and control engineering.

## Lesson Structure & Approach

Each lesson follows our systems-based pedagogical approach:

<Steps>
1. **🔧 Real-World System Problem**
   Begin with complete mechatronic systems (robotic arms, actuators, pressure vessels) facing specific engineering challenges.

2. **📚 Fundamental Theory**
   Develop the mathematical and physical principles needed to analyze and solve the system problem.

3. **🎯 System Application**
   Apply theory to the original system with step-by-step engineering solutions and design verification.

4. **🛠️ Design Guidelines**
   Extract practical rules and best practices for professional mechatronic system design.
</Steps>

## Learning Path

<Steps>
1. **Build a Strong Foundation**
   Master fundamental concepts of stress and strain that form the basis for all mechanical analysis.

2. **Analyze Material Behavior**
   Understand how different materials respond to forces and predict their deformation.

3. **Apply to Complex Systems**
   Learn to analyze multi-component systems with varying properties and constraints.

4. **Design for Real-World Applications**
   Apply mechanics of materials principles to mechatronics challenges including sensors, actuators, and structures.
